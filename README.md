Student Performance Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts student academic performance based on various factors such as study time, attendance, parental background, and other attributes.
It applies multiple machine learning models to analyze data and predict outcomes effectively.

Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Implementation of multiple ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks)

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualizations to interpret student performance

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools/IDE: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook

Dataset

The dataset (AI-Data.csv) includes various attributes such as:

Study time

Attendance

Family background

Exam preparation

Extracurricular activities

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ABISHEK086/Student-Performance-Prediction-ML.git
cd Student-Performance-Prediction-ML


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the project:

python Project.py

Results

Achieved a maximum accuracy of XX% (replace with your result)

Random Forest performed best compared to other models

Data visualization showed strong correlation between study time and performance

Future Enhancements

Deploy as a web application using Flask or Django

Add a real-time prediction dashboard

Experiment with deep learning approaches
